# A quick guide to tmux configuration
#
# This guide assumes you are using tmux version 2.2, but it probably doesn't
# matter.
#
# Aliases:
#   `set`    -> `set-option`
#   `bind`   -> `bind-key`
#   `unbind` -> `unbind-key`
#
#   I will prefer the alias in all cases.
#
# Kinds of options:
#
#   There are three kinds of options in tmux: server, window, and session.
#
#   These are categories of options, not a hierarchy. So an option is always in
#   one of these three categories.
#
#   For example, to change the the time tmux will wait after an escape to
#   determine if it is a key sequence, you change the server option
#   `escape-time` (defaults to 500 milliseconds).
#
#   By default, `set` will change session settings. To change server or window
#   settings, you can provide a flag (`-s` or `-w`, respectively). However, it
#   turns out tmux doesn't care if you provide this flag or not (see:
#   https://github.com/tmux/tmux/commit/f7e9aedf10b2165838daf40b6a71ab764f0a0dee
#   ) so I'll skip specifying them.
#
#   You can specify an option as global with `set -g`. New sessions and windows
#   inherit from the global options and use the global option if a local option
#   has not been set. Since there's only one server, you cannot specify global
#   server options.
#
# Change prefix key from C-b to C-a
# The "a" key is closer to Caps Lock, which I remap to Ctrl, so it's easier to
# type than C-b. C-a is also the default prefix key used in GNU screen (tmux
# predecessor) so some people prefer it.
set -g prefix C-a

# Bind C-a to send the literal prefix key (which is now C-a)
# This means the sequence C-a C-a inside of tmux will act as if you had just
# done C-a outside of tmux. This allows you to go to the beginning character in
# a line by doing C-a C-a.
bind C-a send-prefix

# Unbind C-b since by default it is also bound to send-prefix
unbind C-b

# Start window numbering at 1 to match the ordering on keyboards
set -g base-index 1

# Automatically renumber windows to keep numbers sequential
# By default, if you create 3 windows in tmux they will be labeled 1, 2, and 3.
# If you close window 1, the remaining windows will still be numbered 2 and 3,
# meaning if you add a new window, it will be number 1.
# This option changes it so that when you close window 1, the remaining windows
# are automatically renumbered so window 2 becomes 1 and window 3 becomes 2 and
# new windows would start at 3.
set -g renumber-windows on

# Increase scrollback lines
# tmux defaults to only saving 2000 lines of history. You can increase this as
# much as you want, keeping in mind it will increase the memory usage of tmux.
set -g history-limit 20000

# Open new windows/splits in current working directory instead of home
bind c new-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind % split-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind '"' split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"

# Change date/time to ISO 8601 format
# The default setting for status-right is:
# " \"#{=21:pane_title}\" %H:%M %d-%b-%y" which gives the time/date like
# "14:45 27-Sep-16" but I prefer the ISO 8601 format (e.g.
# "2016-09-27T14:45-0700").
set -g status-right " \"#{=21:pane_title}\" %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M%z"

# Change status bar colors
# Default is "bg=green,fg=black" which is a little harsh
set -g status-style fg=red

# Change color of line dividing panes
set -g pane-border-style fg=blue
set -g pane-active-border-style fg=red
